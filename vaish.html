      <h2>THE LITTLE BOY ON THE BEACH</h2>
     
       
     
      <P>  A short rather plain looking six years old boy ,stood on a sandy beach.             
          As soon as the young boy returned home from school ,he would run to the  beach
          and watch for hours . As he watched ,the seed of the future engineer were being 
          sown. This boy was none other than A. P. J. Abdul Kalam.
